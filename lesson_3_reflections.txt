Can you see this on your local machine?
	yeah bitch
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because the local changes might need merging with the remote commit. It would be nice to do it one time rather than during intermediate steps.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	FORK
		1.multiple repo
		2.No permission to push/pull in original repo
	CLONE
		1.multiple copies of single repo
		2.For collaboration
	BRANCH
		1.single repo
		2.For Bug fix/new feature

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	what if it is not?
		directly push your changes to remote. No way to determine if the new changes break anything. the remote commit history is fragile. Always breaking.
	benfit
		Robust and stable commits go into main branch of remote
